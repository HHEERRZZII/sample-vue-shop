# Vue Sample Shop

This small demo shows how to accept payments with stripe with Vue.js using a
serverless function. It's actually not that bad to set up! The shop also shows
how a number of concepts work in Vue. Server side rendering and routing is done
with Nuxt.js. Centralized state management with Vuex for product details. Of
note, using computed properties, `.sync`, CSS Grid, and `transition-group`.

修改数据3，一定要pull吗？

看看pull代码！
能一步到位吗？
